OS2Web Settings Page
==============================

Description
-----------
OS2Web settings page in administration. This module adds a dummy settings page as replacement for the os2web_settings module to avoid dependencies on OS2Web core.

Installation
-----------
This module should reside in the modules directory of the installation,
most commonly profiles/os2web/modules/, but alternativly in sites/all/modules
(This could be for development purposes).

See https://github.com/syddjurs/os2web/wiki for further instructions.

This module can also be installed with drush make in your install profile.

Additional Info
---------------
This repository should be governed using Git Flow. for more information see
http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/

Note: This module is still dependant on modules in the full OS2Web suite
(https://github.com/OS2web/os2web), as the seperation of those are still WIP.
